# COVID-19 Impact on Economic Indicators: Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes the relationship between COVID-19 metrics and economic indicators across countries. The analysis examines how the pandemic affected GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation across major economies while considering healthcare system capacity factors.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - plotly
  - scipy
  - jupyter

## Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Using venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook file `COVID19_Economic_Impact_Analysis.ipynb` through the Jupyter interface.

The notebook is organized into the following sections:
1. Data Importation & Integration
2. Handling Missing Data & Outliers
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Identify Correlations & Trends Through Visualization
5. Statistical Testing and Hypothesis Verification
6. Key Findings and Conclusions
7. Future Work and Recommendations

## Data Sources

The analysis uses the following datasets:
1. COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins CSSE GitHub repository
2. Simulated World Bank economic indicators (GDP growth, unemployment, inflation)
3. Healthcare system capacity metrics (health expenditure, hospital beds)

## Creating requirements.txt

To create a requirements.txt file with your project dependencies:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, create a minimal requirements.txt with just the required packages:
```
pandas==1.5.3
numpy==1.24.3
matplotlib==3.7.1
seaborn==0.12.2
plotly==5.14.1
scipy==1.10.1
jupyter==1.0.0
```
Note: Replace version numbers with those currently used in your environment.

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals several significant insights:
1. Countries with higher COVID-19 death rates generally experienced worse economic downturns in 2020
2. Health system capacity (hospital beds per 1,000) showed a notable relationship with COVID-19 mortality
3. Countries with higher health expenditure did not necessarily have lower COVID-19 death rates
4. Most countries showed economic recovery in 2021 after the 2020 downturn
5. There's significant variation in how countries were impacted by and responded to the pandemic
