## 🌍 Data Sources

The datasets used in this analysis include:

1. **COVID-19 Data**: [Johns Hopkins CSSE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
2. **Economic Indicators**: Simulated data for **GDP growth**, **unemployment**, and **inflation** from the **World Bank**.
3. **Healthcare System Capacity**: Metrics such as **health expenditure** and **hospital beds per 1,000 people**.

---

## 📝 Key Findings

The analysis reveals several important insights:

1. **Economic Impact**: Countries with higher COVID-19 death rates experienced deeper economic recessions in 2020.
2. **Healthcare System Capacity**: Countries with more hospital beds per capita generally had lower mortality rates.
3. **Health Expenditure**: Higher health spending did not directly correlate with lower death rates.
4. **Recovery in 2021**: Most countries showed signs of economic recovery by 2021.
5. **Country-specific Responses**: The impact of the pandemic varied greatly between nations, reflecting different public health responses and economic recovery strategies.
